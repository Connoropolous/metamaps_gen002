To setup javascript dev, `cd frontend` and then run

    npm install

to set up your testing environment. Then use

    npm test

to see the results of testing the current javascript files.

To build the javascript files, run

    npm run build

If you are actively developing and would like any changes to trigger a rebuild, you can use 

    npm run build:watch

instead.
