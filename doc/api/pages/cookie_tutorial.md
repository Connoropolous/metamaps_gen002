One way to access the API is through your browser. Log into metamaps.cc normally, then browse manually to https://metamaps.cc/api/v2/user/current. You should see a JSON description of your own user object in the database. You can browse any GET endpoint by simply going to that URL and appending query parameters in the URI.

To run a POST or DELETE request, you can use the Fetch API. See the example in the next section.
