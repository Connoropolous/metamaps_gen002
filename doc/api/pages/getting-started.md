There are two ways to log in: token-based authentication, or OAuth 2. If you're testing the API or making simple scripts, token-based is the best. If you're developing an app and want users to be able to log into Metamaps inside your app, you'll be able to use the OAuth 2 mechanism. Check the security tab of any of the endpoints above for instructions on logging in.
